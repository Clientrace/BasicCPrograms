4
mmrz

3.	Opish
Opish is an encoded form of English that is often used by children as a game.  An Opish word is formed from an English word by adding an OP after every consonant sound.  For example, DOG becomes DOPOGOP and CAT becomes COPATOP.  A consonant repeated twice consecutively should be treated as a single consonant.  Example, HELLO in Opish is HOPELLOPO.  Write a program that translates an Eglish sentence into an Opish.

INPUT:		- an English sentence.

OUTPUT:	- its Opish equivalent.

MACHINE PROBLEM 5 - 

President gets advice from his pool of advisers every time he needs to make a decision.  He has 13 top advisers that he really relies on.  But if all of them are involved in any decision, they always end up in an argument where more often than not, the final decision is not achieved.  To resolve this, a scheme was devised where only 5 of the 13 will be randomly chosen to decide on a certain matter.

	They achieved this by having the 13 advisers arrange themselves in a circle.  The President can start counting from a certain adviser with an appropriate counting interval.  For example, he can start counting from adviser 1 with a counting interval of 4.  Then the first adviser counter out will be adviser 4, followed by advisers 8, 12, 3 and 9.  Note that those advisers who are already counted out will not be counted again.

	Write a program that would ask which adviser to start from and ask the counting interval.  Then, it should display which advisers were selected.

Input

	Input to the program will be 2 integers.  The first integer is the starting adviser, which can range from 1 to 13.  The second is the counting interval, which can range from 1 to 100.  Repeat the program until the user enters 0 as the starting adviser.

Output

	Display the advisers which were selected in the order that they were selected each separated by a comma and a space.

Sample Output

	Start	: 5
	Interval	: 5

	Chosen Advisers	: 9, 1, 6, 12, 5

	Start	: 1
	Interval	: 14

	Chosen Advisers	: 1, 3, 6, 10, 4
